# ShoppingListApp


The purpose of this project is for users to create their own shopping lists and manage these lists as they wish. Thanks to this list, the user has the opportunity to observe whether the product in the list is in stock or whether it is a favourite product. This project, which securely stores the data entered by the users, allows users to create shopping lists and follow up on the products in a pleasant way with features that increase the user experience provided by the project to the users. For example, users can add a reminder message about which product to buy and when, thanks to the reminders that users put on the products on their lists. In addition, users can share their shopping lists with other users through this application. Thus, a shared shopping list is formed among users. Shared users can edit this list as they wish.
